  <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2014</span>
  <p>Suddenly snapping out of his romantic daydream after pro-Israel spokesman Dr. Schanzer concluded his lecture, freshman Drew Shapiro, 19, knew he was in love. “I love Israel. She loves Israel. We’re like the same person,” he claimed, as he fondled his Star of David necklace.</p>

<p>Shapiro alleges that he first saw her, when, out of boredom, he scrutinized the audience. “There, a few rows ahead of mine and to the left, I saw a girl clapping. She looked over once, and we made eye contact.” Shapiro claims he did not follow Dr. Schanzer’s lecture following the eye contact. “She’s perfect” Shapiro added.</p>

<p>Despite efforts by Shapiro to draw attention to himself during the lecture by both coughing and spilling water, the girl did not turn her head. According to sources, Shapiro went as far as attempting to “accidentally” bump into her as the audience made their way out, but failed to get in proximity. “I’m not giving up. I’ve talked to my friends, and they all think she likes me,” Shapiro optimistically stated.</p>

<p>Shapiro plans on attending future pro-Israel events to increase his chance of awkwardly running into her again.</p>
